This project is stored inside the book store file. Inside, there is a python file, a book_store_database file, a folder called templates and a folder called instance. The instance folder is autogenerated and is not important to the code.
The book_store_database is the SQL database file that stores all the information.
The python file named app.py is a python wrapper script for the database file so the user can interact and send queries.
The files inside templates are HTML files to store the formatting of the different pages of the website that the python wrapper script hosts.
To run the program, please run the python file in the terminal inside the folder by entering "python app.py" and visiting the website that is given.

Please note that for the purposes of this project, it is to serve as a sample database. For a better application, many of the same functionalities can be added to all the tables but for the purposes of demo, each table has it's own unique functionality.
